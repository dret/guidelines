- How important are the guidelines and what are clear goals and non-goals of the guidelines?

## Process

- Creating/collecting of guidelines
- Review/acceptance/rejection of guidelines
- Advertising/enforcement/support of guidelines

## Model

- Do you have a way of classifying guidelines for specific areas (technical, product, ...) and/or different audiences?

## Experience

## Book
