# API Guidelines

## Notes

- use cases and scenarios: determining what your goals for the guidelines are, so that you can manage them, see whether they are successful as a product, and have ways to design and improve them.

- support sections for different levels or topics

- identify some key audiences so that they can get "filtered views" to avoid guideline fatigue (maybe translate into github labels)

- structure into why/what/how/test

- allowing various maturity stages of guidance (experimental, ...)

- supporting levels of guidance using RFC 2119 concepts

- contribution process should be well-defined and scalable (revisit frequently to make sure guideline growth is healthy and meaningful)

- connecting with "external resources" such as:
 - documents ("standards" set by the organization)
 - standards (actual standards established externally)
 - profiles (org-specific ways of using standards, mentioning RFC 6906 and https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/NOTE-dx-prof-20191218/)
 - tooling (links to documented organization tools)

- talk about automating guideline tests (advantages and limitations)

- clearly address the two main reader groups
 - API program managers looking for how to manage their guidelines
 - API teams looking for how to better document and share practices across teams
