# API Guidelines

## Notes

- use cases and scenarios: determining what your goals for the guidelines are, so that you can manage them, see whether they are successful as a product, and have ways to design and improve them.

- support sections for different levels or topics

- identify some key audiences so that they can get "filtered views" to avoid guideline fatigue (maybe translate into github labels)

- structure into why/what/how/test

- allowing various maturity stages of guidance (experimental, ...)

- supporting levels of guidance using RFC 2119 concepts

- contribution process should be well-defined and scalable (revisit frequently to make sure guideline growth is healthy and meaningful)

- connecting with "external resources" such as documents, standards, tooling, ...
