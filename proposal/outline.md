# API Guidelines: Creating and Managing Guidance for a Successful API Journey

## Outline

1. Part I: Why API Guidelines
 1. Audience: Who is this Book for?
 
    This book is for two main audiences: (1) People involved in API programs, which often are teams that have roles within the overall API initiative and journey of organizations. These people often are organized in teams with names such as *API team*, *API platform team*, *API Center of Excellence*, or *API Center for Enablement*. (2) People involved in API products who want to better understand how to participate in and contribute to the API practice of their organization. Typically, this might include people both with more background from the business side (asking: "how can we build better APIs so that they will be more successful?") as well as the technical side (asking: "how can we make it as easy as possible for API product teams to design and develop APIs that fit well into the organizational landscape?").

 1. The Big Picture: Digital Transformation, API Strategy, API Programs, and API Guidelines

    This chapter sets the stage for the book: Big orgs want to become faster, understand that for this to happen they need to decouple and decentralize with more autonomous teams, and that to make this work at the tech level, the new value chains that they are enabling will be based on APIs. Teams need to understand that APIs matter, they need to understand what matters when they produce and consume APIs, and they need to be supported so that they can focus on creating value. API programs are put into place to create a culture of API production and consumption, and to build an API platform that teams contribute to, and that can be used by both internal and external consumers. API guidelines are the part of the API program that provide guidance why things are done, what is being done, and how it can be done.
 
 1. API Guidelines as Emerging and Evolving Practice

    APIs are the language of digital transformation. API guidelines help to design those languages, so that the API landscape of an organization is more coherent than a random collection of APIs. API guidelines help API producers to be more effective, because they can use established practices and don't have to reinvent the wheel. API guidelines help API consumers because it becomes easier to consume APIs when they are (semi-)coherently designed. API guidelines help to reduce cost because they make it easier to establish practices that then can be supported with infrastructure or tooling. API guidelines should be participatory (bottom-up) instead of authoritarian (top-down). A good start is to observe the existing landscape ("API archaeology") and use the results as a starting point. API guidelines should be thought of as a living document where all API practitioners are contributors, and a few people are editors.
