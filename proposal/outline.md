# API Guidelines: Creating and Managing Guidance for a Successful API Journey

## Outline

1. Part I: Why API Guidelines
 1. The Big Picture: Digital Transformation, API Strategy, API Programs, and API Guidelines
 
    This section sets the stage for the book: Big orgs want to become faster, understand that for this to happen they need to decentralize with more autonomous teams, and that to make this work on a tech level the new value chains that they are building will be based on APIs. Teams need to understand that APIs matter, they need to understand what matters when they produce and consume APIs, and they need to be supported so that they can focus on creating value. API programs are put into place to create a culture of API production and consumption, and to build an API platform that teams contribute to, and that can be used by both internal and external consumers. API guidelines are the part of the API program that provide guidance why things are done, what is being done, and how it can be done.
